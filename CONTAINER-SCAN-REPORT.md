| [CVE-2025-58060](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/09/11/1)|OpenPrinting CUPS is an open source printing system for Linux and other Unix-like operating systems. In versions 2.4.12 and earlier, when the `AuthType` is set to anything but `Basic`, if the request contains an `Authorization: Basic ...` header, the password is not checked. This results in authentication bypass. Any configuration that allows an `AuthType` that is not `Basic` is affected. Version 2.4.13 fixes the issue.|High|Upgrade cups-libs to 1:2.2.6-63.el8_10|

| [CVE-2025-27363](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2025/03/13/1)|An out of bounds write exists in FreeType versions 2.13.0 and below (newer versions of FreeType are not vulnerable) when attempting to parse font subglyph structures related to TrueType GX and variable font files. The vulnerable code assigns a signed short value to an unsigned long and then adds a static value causing it to wrap around and allocate too small of a heap buffer. The code then writes up to 6 signed long integers out of bounds relative to this buffer. This may result in arbitrary code execution. This vulnerability may have been exploited in the wild.|High|Upgrade freetype to 2.9.1-10.el8_10|

Only Python versions 3.12 or later are affected by these vulnerabilities, earlier versions don't include the extraction filter feature.Note that for Python 3.14 or later the default value of filter= changed from "no filtering" to `"data", so if you are relying on this new default behavior then your usage is also affected.Note that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build process. However when evaluating source distributions it's important to avoid installing source distributions with suspicious links.|High|Upgrade python3-libs to 3.6.8-70.el8_10|
| [CVE-2025-4138](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:10189)|Allows the extraction filter to be ignored, allowing symlink targets to point outside the destination directory, and the modification of some file metadata.You are affected by this vulnerability if using the tarfile module to extract untrusted tar archives using TarFile.extractall() or TarFile.extract() using the filter= parameter with a value of "data" or "tar". See the tarfile  extraction filters documentation https://docs.python.org/3/library/tarfile.html#tarfile-extraction-filter  for more information.Note that for Python 3.14 or later the default value of filter= changed from "no filtering" to `"data", so if you are relying on this new default behavior then your usage is also affected.Note that none of these vulnerabilities significantly affect the installation of source distributions which are tar archives as source distributions already allow arbitrary code execution during the build process.

| [CVE-2024-12085](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2025:0324)|A flaw was found in rsync which could be triggered when rsync compares file checksums. This flaw allows an attacker to manipulate the checksum length (s2length) to cause a comparison between a checksum and uninitialized memory and leak one byte of uninitialized stack data at a time.|High|Upgrade rsync to 3.1.3-20.el8_10|
| [CVE-2025-6965](http://seclists.org/fulldisclosure/2025/Sep/49)|There exists a vulnerability in SQLite versions before 3.50.2 where the number of aggregate terms could exceed the number of columns available. This could lead to a memory corruption issue. We recommend upgrading to version 3.50.2 or above.|High|Upgrade sqlite-libs to 3.26.0-20.el8_10|
